# Shopping-list-application

Shopping list application is an application where user can add items and amount to the list. Item and amount are both string, because I thought that it is user friendlier to write "1 ts" to one text field than writing "1" to one and "ts" to other text field. User can also delete checked items or all items. If user tries to add item that already exists in the list, he will get a pop-up window. It also remembers user's checked boxes when he closes application, but user has to click sometimes on "refresh" button for table to appear. I didn't think a lot about colors of the application, so I took Android Studio's primary colors which might be too bright. 

There are 2 classes (Activities): one for list and one for pop-up window. And 2 Layouts for each class. There is also drawable xml file for both activity backrounds.

This application doesn't have any automated tests, because I couldn't figure out how to make them...

Used Kotlin first time in my life.
